            <h2>Interfaces</h2>
            <p>An Interface is a structure which acts as a contract in our application. It defines the syntax for classes to follow, means a class which implements an interface is bound to implement all its members. We cannot instantiate the interface, but it can be referenced by the class object that implements it. </p>

            <h2>Enums</h2>
            <p>
                An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
                
                Enums come in two flavors string and numeric. Lets start with numeric.</p>
