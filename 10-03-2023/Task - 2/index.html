    <h1>Access Specifiers -</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Public - </h2>
            <p>In TypeScript by default, all the members (properties and methods) of a class are public. So, there is no need to prefix members with this keyword. We can access this data member anywhere without any restriction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Private - </h2>
            <p>The private access modifier cannot be accessible outside of its containing class. It ensures that the class members are visible only to that class in which it is containing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Protected - </h2>
            <p>A Protected access modifier can be accessed only within the class and its subclass. We cannot access it from the outside of a class in which it is containing.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
