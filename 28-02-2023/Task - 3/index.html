    <h2 class="heading">What does navigation bar mean?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">A navigation bar is a link to appropriate sections/pages in a website that helps readers in
        traversing the online document. Considered a traditional method of navigation, a navigation bar can be
        implemented in a number of ways, namely, horizontally or vertically, or fixed or dynamic. A navigation bar
        implementation is considered one of the key points of Web design and usability.<br>
        <br>A navigation bar helps readers in selecting topics, links or sub-topics of their interest. Using a navigation
        bar, users need not enter the URL of the specific webpage, as this is automatically taken care of by the
        navigation bar, with the navigation sections having embedded the necessary links of the webpage. A navigation
        bar also helps users, as it is easily locatable. For Web developers, creating a navigation bar helps in
        separating content from structure. This helps them in modifying style or providing creativity to the structure
        without impacting the information present in the pages. As such, a navigation bar is considered a make-or-break
        design for the whole webpage.<br>

        <br>A navigation bar uses standard HTML as the base for any online document. It consists of a number of links that
        are called upon based on user action.<br>

        <br>A navigation bar can be primarily classified into either fixed/sticky or dynamic. Faster browsing and easier
        navigation are hallmarks of sticky navigation bars. Dynamic navigation bars are used when space is a constraint
        and when translation issues, especially in mobile formats, are encountered. There are other classifications of
        navigation bars, for example, based on the position (vertical or horizontal) and based on the text and graphics
        (text-only or graphics-only navigation bar).
