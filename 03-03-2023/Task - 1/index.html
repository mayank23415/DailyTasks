    <h1>Throw, Try, Catch and Finally</h1>
    <h2>What is exception?</h2>
    <p>An exception is an “unwanted or unexpected event”, which occurs during the execution of the program i.e, at run-time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. When an exception occurs, the execution of the program gets terminated. </p>
    <h2>How to handle exception?</h2>
    <p>To handle exceptions we use try, catch and finally blocks - </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>try :</h3>
            The try block contains a set of statements where an exception can occur.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>catch :</h3>
            The catch block is used to handle the uncertain condition of a try block. A try block is always followed by a catch block, which handles the exception that occurs in the associated try block.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>finally :</h3>
            It is executed after the catch block. We use it to put some common code (to be executed irrespective of whether an exception has occurred or not ) when there are multiple catch blocks. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>throw :</h3>
            The throw statement allows you to create a custom error. Technically you can throw an exception (throw an error). The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example of error handling -</h2>
    <label for="monthNumber">Month Number :</label>
    <input type="number" id="monthNumber">
    <button type="button" onclick="getMonthName()">Month</button>
    <h1 id="printMonthName"></h1>
