        <h1>SASS</h1>
        <p>Sass is the short form of Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet. It is an upgrade to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sass is a CSS pre-processor. It is fully compatible with every version of CSS. Sass reduces the repetition of CSS and therefore saves time. It was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006. Sass is free to download and use.</p>
