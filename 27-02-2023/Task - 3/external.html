    <h1>External CSS</h1>
    <p>This file implements external css addition using link tag. The link tag specifies the relation between the current file and the added file and uses to href attribute to apply the css file to the current html document.This is considered to be the best practise as we can just make one css file and use it on multiple html documents which provides code reusability.</p>
