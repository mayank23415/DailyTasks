    <h1>Selector Grouping</h1>
    <p>As you know, we can use a "class" or "id" to target a specific element so that some style can be applied to them. These are a particular type of CSS selectors that makes CSS styling distinct. But there is also another type of selector available that can use the collective elements for the style simultaneously. In this chapter, you will learn about the Group Selector in CSS.</p>
    <h2>CSS Grouping Selector</h2>
    <article>As you have used the different CSS selectors that only target either a class or an ID or a single element for applying the styles. Nevertheless, CSS also allows making it incredibly easy for targeting more than one element at a time to allow for specific CSS properties and rules. To do this, you have to separate the selector's names with a comma, and you are good to implement CSS styles on many elements.</article>
    <br>
    <article>This is one of the coolest features of CSS, which is meant for greater code re-usability as there is no ground for specifying the similar properties on some elements or classes separately when CSS has the possibility to re-use them.</article>
    <p>
        For example - h1, h2{color:red} or p, article{color:grey}.
